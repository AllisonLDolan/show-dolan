## Sushi
the reason I like sushi is because it's **refreshing and very filling**. Theres's many different ways you can get it and **there are plenty of options and many without raw fish or being spicy**. It's so different from anything we do in regular American foods that it's a nice break. Not to mention I just love seafood in general.
